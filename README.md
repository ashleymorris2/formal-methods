# Formal-Methods

The purpose of this program was to gain an understanding of formal programming methods by using the C# "Code Contracts" library.

A carpark simulation was used as the scenario.

Pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants were imposed on the methods of the CarPark class in order to guarantee that the program is always in a "correct" state and meets the program specification at all times. 

An example for a post-condition could be that the same car is unable to enter the car park twice.

If another developer was to implement the CarPark class they would find that the formal specification imposes restrictions on how they are able to call functions and what parameters they are able to pass.
